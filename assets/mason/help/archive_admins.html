Not all archives are monitored equally well by <%$s->{niceName}%>. For your archive content to be reliably indexed, we recommend that you use OAI sets to organize its contents. You should make sure that you have a set for <%lc $SUBJECT%> material and tell <%$s->{niceName}%> to index just that set when configuring your archive.You shouldn't try to make <%$s->{niceName}%> index content that is not relevant to the site, because this will lead to your archive being avoided by the indexer.
