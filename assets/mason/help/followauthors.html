<& "../header.html", title=>"Using the 'follow authors' feature"&>
First time you use the 'follow authors' feature you will be asked if you want to follow anonymously
or publicly.  If you choose to follow publicly other people and the authors themselves would see who do you
follow.  The <a href="/profile/myfollowings.pl">Authors I follow</a> page lets you choose individual aliases an
author could use.  For example Alan Mathison Turing usually uses 'A. M. Turing' to sign the papers but there are
some signed 'Alan M. Turing' and 'A. Turing' in our database.  To compute the list of possible aliases we use
a heuristic algorithm and it is not perfect - you might scan the list of aliases and untick those that
you don't want to follow.  You can also remove an author name together with it's aliases using the 'remove' button.
