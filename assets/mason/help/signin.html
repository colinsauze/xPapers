It is possible to sign in to third-party web sites using your <%$s->{niceName}%> account (if this has been enabled by the third party site). Doing so allows you to use your account's proxy settings and 'At my library' settings to access subscription-only resources from third-party sites. 
<p>
If you would like to enable this feature on your web site, please <a href="/help/contact.html">contact us</a> for more information.
