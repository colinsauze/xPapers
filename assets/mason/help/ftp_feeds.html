<h2>The FTP push protocol</h2>

On this protocol, journal metadata are uploaded to <% $s->{niceName} %> by
 journal editors as they become available. Some journal hosting
 companies (e.g. Atypon) already support this protocol.

 In order to use this protocol, you must first obtain a user id and
 password from the <% $s->{niceName} %> General Editors (<a href="/help/contact.html">contact us</a>), and submit a list of the
 titles you would like to be indexed. Metadata should be uploaded as
 follows.
 <p>
 <h3>Connecting to the server</h3>

 The FTP server is <% $s->{feedServer} %>. It does not use secure FTP but
 normal FTP. You will use the username and password provided to you by the editors.

 <p>
 <h3>What to upload</h3>
 <% $s->{niceName} %> only indexes research articles and book reviews. Please do not upload prefaces, errata and the like.

 <p>
 <h3>The file format</h3>

 <% $s->{niceName} %> supports the <a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/">
     NLM Archiving and Interchange</a> format versions 1.0 and 2.2 
 with one article per file.
 <ul>
     <li><a href="nlm_example.html">Example of an XML file representing a regular journal article.</a>
     <li><a href="nlm_example_review.html">Example of an XML file representing a book review.</a>
 </ul>
 Not all elements included in the examples are mandatory. For a regular journal article, the mandatory elements are:
 <ul>
    <li>Authors' names</li>
    <li>Article title</li>
    <li>Journal name (journal title)</li>
    <li>Volume, issue, and page numbers</li>
    <li>Either a DOI or a link to the full text of the article (we prefer to have both)</li>
    <li>An abstract</li>
 </ul>
 For book reviews:
 <ul>
    <li>Authors' names</li>
    <li>Either a title for the review or the author(s) and title(s) of the reviewed works (it is best when both can be provided).</li>
    <li>Journal name</li>
    <li>Volume, issue, and page numbers</li>
    <li>Either a DOI or a link to the full text of the review</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 <h3>Packaging the files</h3>

 You can upload separate nlm files or zip archives.  Currently only the 
 zip compression format is supported (on Unix/Linux use
 "$zip -r directory.zip directory"
 command to zip a directory).

 Uploaded files should have unique names. For example, files could be
 named sequentially ("upload1.zip", "upload2.zip", etc.).

 Metadata from different journals can be combined in the same zip files.

 <p>
 <h3>Important notes</h3>

     <ul>
         <li>Use only entities defined in the appriopriate DTD. Preferably, use only standard XML entities.</li>
         <li><% $s->{niceName} %> may not index all the items for which you submit
         metadata. In general, front matter material is discarded.</li>
         <li>Make sure to review your journals in the index. Use the "browse
         journals" feature for this, as the "recent items" page may not show
         everything that you upload.</li>
         <li>It can take up to 24 hours for uploaded material to become available on <% $s->{niceName} %>.</li>
     </ul>
