BARISO||||1385 - Time||||In support of significant modernization of original mathematical texts (in defense of presentism)||||Philosophia Mathematica||||||||At their extremes, the modernization of ancient mathematical texts (absolute presentism) leaves nothing of the source and the refusal to modernize (absolute antiquarism) changes nothing. The extremes exist only as tendencies. This paper attempts to justify the admissibility of broad modernization of mathematical sources (presentism) in the context of a socio-cultural (non-fundamentalist) philosophy of mathematics||||Barabashev, A.

MELUP||||6262 - Classical Greek Philosophy||||Understanding Plato||||||||||||This incisive book fills the longstanding need for a sound, reliable, and balanced guide to the whole of Plato's philosophical work. Melling describes the different stages in Plato's philosophical development, introduces his different methods and styles of philosophy, and explains why the debates were important then and what sense we can make of them now. Against the background of the ancient Greek world, Melling illuminates Plato the man, his writings, and, above all, why his ideas should be considered important two thousand years after his death||||Melling, David J.||||

DEMTST||||6729 - Eastern European Philosophy||||The sociological tradition of hungarian philosophy||||Studies in East European Thought|||||||| In this introductory paper I sketch the tradition, several early aspects of which are discussed in the following essays and reviews. I introduce the main figures whose work initiated and maintained the sociological orientation in Hungarian philosophy thereby tracing its evolution. I suggest that its sociological outlook, if taken to be a characteristic tendency that gives Hungarian philosophy its distinctive flavour, provides us with the framework of a possible narrative about the history of Hungarian philosophy in the broader context of Central European philosophy. This narrative, in turn, suggests a way of integrating the latter into the history of Western philosophy rather than restricting its scope to a handful of canonical works only||||Demeter, Tamas||||Demeter, Tamas

METCOJ-2||||130 - Philosophy of Consciousness||||Commentary on jakab's _Ineffability of Qualia_||||Consciousness and Cognition||||*Linguistics;*Perception;*Psychological Theories;Auditory Perception;Functionalism;Visual Perception||||Zoltan Jakab has presented an interesting conceptual analysis of the ineffability of qualia in a functionalist and classical cognitivist framework. But he does not want to commit himself to a certain metaphysical thesis on the ontology of consciousness or qualia. We believe that his strategy has yielded a number of highly relevant and interesting insights, but still suffers from some minor inconsistencies and a certain lack of phenomenological and empirical plausibility. This may be due to some background assumptions relating to the theory of mental representation employed. Jakab||||Metzinger, Thomas||||Metzinger, T.::Walde, B.
