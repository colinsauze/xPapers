<h1>About FWS-ore</h1>

<p>
This Food and Water Security online research resource (FWS-ore) project was initiated in July 2011 at the request of Aberystwyth University's President, Sir Emyr Jones-Parry following an idea that came out of discussions with Professor Ken Booth, also of Aberystwyth University.</p>

<p>FWS-ore is an online key-guide to academic papers in the field of Food and Water Security and is based upon Xpapers software written by David Bourget and his team at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. </p>

<p>The FWS-ore project team at Aberystwyth is directed by Professor John Grattan, Dean of Science and is comprised of Tim Williams, Project Manager;  Antony Corfield, web and repository developer; Justa Hopma, FWS-ore Sub-Editor; Colin Sauz&eacute;, web site, developer and Claire Q, web site developer. The design art and logo for FWS-ore was produced by Dylan Thomas and Howard Adair. Advice and support for the project and its definition came from Tim Davies; Hannah Payne; Gary Reed and Iola Hagen. The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) provided advice on the suitability and compliance of Xpapers and the project mission.</p>

<p>FWS-ore Functions</p>
<ol>
<li>Automated, editor-mediated, meta-data harvesting builds an extensive archive of academic papers categorised under the Food & Water Security heading</li>
<li>Researchers upload their own research papers into FWS-ore's archive</li>
<li>Specialist editors write reviews of papers, forming a learning framework, thereby adding value to the archived material</li>
<li>Researchers and student members of FWS-ore use it to build their own collections of academic papers and reviews</li>
<li>Members use online discussions with other users to form social networks and special interest groups</li>
</ol>

<p>Our aspiration is that FWS-ore's server architecture and work-flow will enable in-site systematic reviews of papers to produce new, synthesised research findings</p>

<p>FWS-ore has a development blog: <a href="http://fws-hub.blogspot.com/">http://fws-hub.blogspot.com</a> and a code development repository: <a href="https://github.com/fws-hub">https://github.com/fws-hub</a>
