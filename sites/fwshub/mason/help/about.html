<h1>About C3W-publications</h1>

<p>
This Climate Change Consortium Wales online research resource (C3W-publications) project was initiated in January 2012 at the request of Aberystwyth University's President, Sir Emyr Jones-Parry following an idea that came out of discussions with Professor Ken Booth, also of Aberystwyth University.</p>

<p>C3W-publications is an online key-guide to academic papers in the field of Food and Water Security and is based upon Xpapers software written by David Bourget and his team at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. </p>

<p>The C3W-publications project team at Aberystwyth is directed by Tim Williams, Project Manager;  Colin Sauz&eacute, web site, developer and Claire Q, web site developer. The design art and logo for FWS-ore was produced by Dylan Thomas and Howard Adair. Advice and support for the project and its definition came from Tim Davies; Hannah Payne; Gary Reed and Iola Hagen. The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) provided advice on the suitability and compliance of Xpapers and the project mission.</p>

<p>C3W-publications Functions</p>
<ol>
<li>Automated, editor-mediated, meta-data harvesting builds an extensive archive of academic papers categorised under the Climate Change heading</li>
<li>Researchers upload their own research papers into C3W-publications' archive</li>
<li>Specialist editors write reviews of papers, forming a learning framework, thereby adding value to the archived material</li>
<li>Researchers and student members of C3W-publications use it to build their own collections of academic papers and reviews</li>
<li>Members use online discussions with other users to form social networks and special interest groups</li>
