This page contains entries that have not yet been categorized under a finer-grained category.  The goal is to eventually move all entries down to the leaf level (using "Misc" categories as required).  In addition to fine-grained categorization via the "categorize" link under every entry, you can perform quick categorization on pages like this one by using the links provided to copy entries down to relevant sub-categories (not necessarily leaf categories). Once you have copied an entry to all potentially relevant sub-categories (be liberal), you should remove it from this list using the link provided.

To spot non-leaf categories in need of categorization work, look for non-leaf categories which have two entry counts. For example a count of "1004/56" indicates a non-leaf category with 56 local entries in need of further categorization.  In addition, the "uncategorized material" page will always have many entries that are yet to be categorized at all.
